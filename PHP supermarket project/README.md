#PHP Supermarket project
Created an user interactive Supermarket PLU list. The user is always able to see the PLU list with the name, PLU number and an image if available, however in order to edit the list the user must login first. If the credentials are correct, the user will be granted the option to manage the list, adding the option to add a new item name, PLU and a new image.
